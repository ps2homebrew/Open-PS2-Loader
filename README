Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Open PS2 Loader (OPL) is a 100% Open source game and application loader for 
the PS2 and PS3 units. It now supports *.ISO images on HDD, Ethernet SMB 
shares, and USB while also maintaining compatibility with USB Advance/Extreme 
format. It's now the most compatible homebrew loader and it should work 
without ps2load or change DNASXXX.IMG tricks. 

All PlayStation 2 models, including the SCPH-10000, SCPH-15000, SCPH-18000 and PSX (DVR unit) units are supported.

OPL is also developed continuously - anyone can contribute improvements to 
the project due to its open source nature.

How to use
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

OPL uses the same directory tree structure across HDD, SMB, and 
USB modes ... 
 
--- "CD"  (for games on CD media - i.e. blue-bottom discs) 
--- "DVD  (for DVD5 images; DVD9 images on USB must be split) 
--- "VMC" (for 8MB Virtual Memory Card images) 
--- "CFG" (for saving per-game configuation files) 
--- "ART" (for box and disc art images)
--- "THM" (for themes support) 

---
USB
---
USB disks up to 2TB are supported. For best effects, please use a USB HDD unit instead of a USB flash disk, as the latter is known to have slightly worse access times.

Game files on USB devices must be perfectly defragmented and disc images larger than 4GB must be split to avoid the 4GB
limitation of the FAT32 file system. We recommend the Auslogics Disk Defragmenter 
for best defragging results, and our own comman line tool iso2usbld to
convert or split games into USB Advance/Extreme format ...

Other utilities are: USBUtil 2.0, USB Extreme installer or USB Insane.

---
SMB
---
For loading games by SMB protocol you need to share a folder (ex: PS2SMB)
on the host machine or NAS device and make sure that it has full read and 
write permissions. USB Advance/Extreme format is optional - *.ISO images 
are supported using the folder structure above with the added bonus that 
DVD9 images don't have to be split if your SMB device uses the NTFS or 
EXT3/4 file system. 

----
HDD
----
For PS2, 48-bit LBA HDD units up to 2TB are supported. They have to be 
formatted with either WINHIIP or uLaunch. From there, use uLaunch to make a 
partition (rec. minumum of 2GB) named "OPL". If OPL detects this partition 
at start up, it'll automatically create the above directory structure. Use
it to migrate ART, THEMES, CFGs, VMCs, etc. off your MC or USB stick to the
internal HDD and free up space on those devices. 

To launch OPL, you can use any of the existing methods for loading an 
executable elf.

On PS3, you need an original SwapMagic 3.6+ or 3.8 disc (at the moment
there aren't any other options). The steps for loading OPL on a PS3 are:

    1. Rename OPNPS2LD.ELF to SMBOOT0.ELF
	2. Make a folder in root of USB device called SWAPMAGIC and copy 
	   SMBOOT0.ELF to it.
	3. Launch SwapMagic in PS3 and press UP+L1 then Open PS2 Loader should
	   start.
	   
There are 4 forms for launching elfs in SwapMagic.

SMBOOT0.ELF = UP + L1
SMBOOT1.ELF = UP + L2
SMBOOT2.ELF = UP + R1
SMBOOT3.ELF = UP + R2

Some notes for devs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Open PS2 Loader needs the latest PS2SDK
